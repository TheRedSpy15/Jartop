## Secure?
Jartop was written in Java, and runs in a JVM, inherently making it secure.

But there are ___many___ other security measures built in:

- AES-128/256 with SHA-128/256 hashing (___Encryption___)
- Secure wiping of account after so many failed attempts (___Forensics___)
- Secure and private browser (___Browsing___)
- Account hashing (___Integrity___)
- Open source (___Trustworthy___)

## Customise?
You can choose a wallpaper for your taste, or pick a favorite color for your theme. You can also add
your contacts, passwords, calenders and such to your user.

## How do you use Jartop?
You start out by creating a user at the login menu, then just use it as you would with a regular computer!
Just make sure to remember your login password, there is zero way for anyone (not even government officals) to
retrieve them!

## Road Map?
We have long term plans for Jartop. Many of those plans are big, and some are small.
We have a trello page with all the currently planned, and still considering features for
the future of Jartop
