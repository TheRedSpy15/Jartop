A virtual desktop running in Java, designed to emulate an actual desktop. Meant for seniors who need a simple computer, schools

## Secure?
[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/theredspy15/jartop/badge.svg?targetFile=build.gradle)](https://snyk.io/test/github/theredspy15/jartop?targetFile=build.gradle)

Jartop was written in Java, and runs in a JVM, inherently making it secure.

But there are ___many___ other security measures built in:

- Tor (___Connections___)
- AES-128/256 with SHA-128/256 hashing (___Encryption___)
- Secure wiping of account after so many failed attempts (___Forensics___)
- Secure and private browser (___Browsing___)
- Account hashing (___Integrity___)
- Open source (___Trustworthy___)

## Customise?
You can choose a wallpaper for your taste, or pick a favorite color for your theme. You can also add
your contacts, passwords, calenders and such to your user.

## How do you use Jartop?
You start out by creating a user at the login menu, then just use it as you would with a regular computer!
Just make sure to remember your login password, there is zero way for anyone (not even government officals) to
retrieve them!

## Road Map?
We have long term plans for Jartop. Many of those plans are big, and some are small.
We have a trello page with all the currently planned, and still considering features for
the future of Jartop

## Requirements?
Currently, you need Java 8+ downloaded on you pc before Jartop can run. It is planned for this requirement to be
removed in the future however.

Currently the hardware requirements need at least 500 mb RAM and at least a 720p display.

### Please know...
Jartop development is currently on hold. It started out as a learning project, and as I want to continue learning,
I am pausing updates to the project. This is largely due to little interest being shown. If I see more people staring
the repo, or issues being posted on the repo, I will resume progress. Jartop is under the MIT license (shown below),
please fork this repo if you wish to take the development into your own hands.
